# XAI-Based-Deep-Neural-Breast-Cancer-Detection
We propose the Deep Neural Breast Cancer Detection (DNBCD) system, a deep learning-based model for accurate breast cancer detection using the BreakHis-400x and BUSI datasets. It addresses class imbalance with class weighting and uses Grad-CAM for interpretability.
